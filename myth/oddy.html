        <h3>Homer</h3>
        <p>
            Homer (flourished 9th or 8th century BCE?, Ionia? [now in Turkey])
            was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
            Although these two great epic poems of ancient Greece and Classical
            antiquity have always been attributed to the shadowy figure of
            Homer, little is known of him beyond the fact that his was the name
            attached in antiquity by the Greeks themselves to the poems. That
            there was an epic poet called Homer and that he played the primary
            part in shaping the Iliad and the Odyssey—so much may be said to
            be probable. If this assumption is accepted, then Homer must
            assuredly be one of the greatest of the world’s literary artists.
            He is also one of the most influential authors in the widest sense, for the two epics provided the basis of Greek
            education and culture throughout the Classical age and formed the backbone of humane education down to the
            time of the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity. Indirectly through the medium of Virgil’s Aeneid
            (which was loosely molded after the patterns of the Iliad and the Odyssey), directly through their revival under
            Byzantine culture from the late 8th century CE onward, and subsequently through their passage into Italy with the
            Greek scholars who fled westward from the Ottomans, the Homeric epics had a profound impact on the
            Renaissance culture of Italy. Since then the proliferation of translations has helped to make them the most
            important poems of the Classical European tradition.
            It was probably through their impact on Classical Greek culture itself that the Iliad and the Odyssey most subtly
            affected Western standards and ideas. The Greeks regarded the great epics as something more than works of
            literature; they knew much of them by heart, and they valued them not only as a symbol of Hellenic unity and
            heroism but also as an ancient source of moral and even practical instruction.

        <h3>Early References</h3>
        <p>
            Implicit references to Homer and quotations from the poems date to the middle of the 7th century BCE.
            Archilochus, Alcman, Tyrtaeus, and Callinus in the 7th century and Sappho and others in the early 6th adapted
            Homeric phraseology and metre to their own purposes and rhythms. At the same time scenes from the epics
            became popular in works of art. The pseudo-Homeric “Hymn to Apollo of Delos,” probably of late 7th-century
            composition, claimed to be the work of “a blind man who dwells in rugged Chios,” a reference to a tradition
            about Homer himself. The idea that Homer had descendants known as “Homeridae,” and that they had taken over
            the preservation and propagation of his poetry, goes back at least to the early 6th century BCE. Indeed, it was not
            long before a kind of Homeric scholarship began: Theagenes of Rhegium in southern Italy toward the end of the
            same century wrote the first of many allegorizing interpretations. By the 5th century biographical fictions were
            well under way; the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heracleitus of Ephesus made use of a trivial legend of Homer’s
            death—that it was caused by chagrin at not being able to solve some boys’ riddle about catching lice—and the
            concept of a contest of quotations between Homer and Hesiod (after Homer the most ancient of Greek poets) may
            have been initiated in the Sophistic tradition. The historian Herodotus assigned the formulation of Greek theology
            to Homer and Hesiod and claimed that they could have lived no more than 400 years before his own time, the 5th
            century BCE. This should be contrasted with the superficial assumption, popular in many circles throughout
            antiquity, that Homer must have lived not much later than the Trojan War about which he sang.

        <h3>Modern Inferences</h3>
        <p>
            The internal evidence of the poems is of some use in determining when Homer lived. Certain elements of the
            poetic language, which was an artificial amalgam never exactly reproduced in speech, indicate that the epics were
            not only post-Mycenaean in composition but also substantially later than the foundation of the first Ionian
            settlements in Asia Minor of about 1000 BCE. The running together of adjacent short vowels and the
            disappearance of the semivowel digamma (a letter formerly existing in the Greek alphabet) are the most
            significant indications of this. At the other end of the time scale the development in the poems of a true definite
            article, for instance, represents an earlier phase than is exemplified in the poetry of the middle and late 7th
            century. Both stylistically and metrically, the Homeric poems appear to be earlier than the Hesiodic poems, which
            many scholars place not long after 700 BCE. A different and perhaps more precise criterion is provided by datable
            objects and practices mentioned in the poems. Nothing, except for one or two probably Athenian additions, seems
            from this standpoint to be later than about 700; on the other hand, the role assigned in the Odyssey to the
            Phoenicians as traders, together with one or two other phenomena, suggests a date of composition—for the
            relevant contexts at least—of sometime after 900. A few passages in the Iliad may imply a new form of fighting
            in close formation, dependent on the development of special armour for foot soldiers (hoplites) after about 750,
            and references to the Gorgon mask as a decorative motif point in the same direction. It is true that the poems
            contain many traditional and archaic elements, and their language and material background are a compound of
            different constituents originating at different dates. It seems, nonetheless, plausible to conclude that the period of
            composition of the large-scale epics (as distinct from their much shorter predecessors) was the 9th or 8th century,
            with several features pointing more clearly to the 8th. The Odyssey may belong near the end of this century, the
            Iliad closer to its middle. It may be no coincidence that cults of Homeric heroes tended to spring up toward the
            end of the 8th century, and that scenes from the epic begin to appear on pots at just about the same time.

        <h3>Poetic Techniques</h3>
        <p>
            It looks, therefore, as though Homer must have trained as an ordinary aoidos, who began (like most of the
            present-day Yugoslav guslari) by building up a repertoire of normal-length songs acquired from already
            established singers. The greatest heroic adventures of the past must already have been prominent in any
            repertoire, especially the Panhellenic adventures of the Seven Against Thebes, the Argonauts, and the Achaean
            attack on Troy. Some aspects of the Trojan War might already have been expanded into songs of unusual length,
            though one that was still manageable on a single occasion. Yet the process was presumably carried much further
            in the making of the monumental Iliad, consisting of more than 16,000 verses, which would take four or five long
            evenings, and perhaps more, to perform. This breakthrough into the monumental, which made exceptional and
            almost unreasonable demands of audiences, presupposes a singer of quite exceptional capacity and reputation—
            one who could impose the new and admittedly difficult form upon his listeners by the sheer unfamiliar genius of
            his song. The 8th century BCE was in other respects, too, an era of cultural innovation, not least in the direction of
            monumentality, and huge temples (like the early temple of Hera in Samos) and colossal funerary vases (like the
            mixing bowls and amphorae in the so-called Geometric style from the Dipylon cemetery in Athens) may have
            found a literary analogue in the idea of a vast poetical treatment of the Trojan War. But in an important sense
            Homer was building upon a tendency of all known oral heroic poetry toward elaboration and expansion. The
            singer does not acquire a song from another singer by simple memorization. He adjusts what he hears to his
            existing store of phrases, typical scenes, and themes, and he tends to replace what is unfamiliar to him with
            something he already knows, or to expand it by adding familiar material that it happens to lack. Every singer in a
            living oral tradition tends to develop what he acquires. There is an element of improvisation, as well as of
            memory, in his appropriation of fresh material; and judging by the practice of singers studied from the middle of
            the 19th century onward in Russia, Serbia, Cyprus, and Crete the inclination to adjust, elaborate, and improve
            comes naturally to all oral poets.

        <h3>Homer and <i>The Odyssey</i></h3>
        <p>
            The Odyssey tends to be blander in expression and sometimes more diffuse in the progress of its action, but it
            presents an even more complex and harmonious structure than the Iliad. The main elements are the situation in
            Ithaca, where Penelope, Odysseus’ wife, and their young son, Telemachus, are powerless before her arrogant
            suitors as they despair of Odysseus’ return from the siege of Troy; Telemachus’ secret journey to the Peloponnese
            for news of his father, and his encounters there with Nestor, Menelaus, and Helen; Odysseus’ dangerous passage,
            opposed by the sea-god Poseidon himself, from Calypso’s island to that of the Phaeacians, and his narrative there
            (from book 9 to book 12) of his fantastic adventures after leaving Troy, including his escape from the cave of the
            Cyclops, Polyphemus; his arrival back in Ithaca, solitary and by night, at the poem’s halfway point, followed by
            his meeting with his protector-goddess Athena, his elaborate disguises, his self-revelation to the faithful
            swineherd Eumaeus and then to Telemachus, their complicated plan for disposing of the suitors, and its gory
            fulfillment. Finally comes the recognition by his faithful Penelope, his recounting to her of his adventures, his
            meeting with his aged father, Laertes, and the restitution, with Athena’s help, of stability in his island kingdom of
            Ithaca. (See also Greek literature: The genres.)
            Homer’s influence seems to have been strongest in some of the most conspicuous formal components of the
            poems. The participation of the gods can both dignify human events and make them seem trivial—or tragic; it
            must for long have been part of the heroic tradition, but the frequency and the richness of the divine assemblies in
            the Iliad, or the peculiarly personal and ambivalent relationship between Odysseus and Athena in the Odyssey,
            probably reflect the taste and capacity of the main composer. The many-sidedness of battle, the equivocal realism
            of death in a hundred forms, must have been developed among Homer’s predecessors but can never before have
            been deployed with such massive and complex effect. In the extended similes the strain of heroic action is
            relieved by the illuminating intrusion of a quite different and often peaceful contemporary world, in images
            developed often almost longingly beyond the immediate point of comparison. These similes, in their placing and
            their detail at least, surely depend on the main composer. And yet, beyond such general intuitions as these, the
            attempt to isolate his special contributions often becomes self-defeating. The Iliad and the Odyssey owe their
            unique status precisely to the creative and therefore unanalyzable confluence of tradition and design, the
            crystalline fixity of a formulaic style and the mobile spontaneity of a brilliant personal vision. “Homer” implies,
            above all, this fusion.
            The result is an impressive amalgam of literary power and refinement. The Iliad and the Odyssey, however, owe
            their preeminence not so much to their antiquity and to their place in Greek culture as a whole but to their
            timeless success in expressing on a massive scale so much of the triumph and the frustration of human life.
            Although all literature must be engaged with that to some degree, epic poems are not where one most expects to
            find it. But these poems rise above the immediate concerns of heroic battle or the struggle against gods and nature
            or against monstrous forces, and they do so with the help of a poetical language of great simplicity and subtlety, a
            rugged and surprisingly variable narrative technique, and a nucleus of remarkable tales set around the Trojan War
            and its aftermath. Their greatest power lies, perhaps, in their dramatic quality because much of each poem
            consists of conversation and speeches, in which rhetoric is kept firmly under control and the individual characters
            emerge as they confront each other and the gods with advice, inquiry, request, resignation, and passion. Achilles,
            Hector, Menelaus, Ajax, Odysseus, and the others acquire a kind of heroic glow that even Greek tragedy later
            found hard to emulate. That is the result, in part, of the very archaism of these age-old tales, which the special
            techniques of monumental composition never attempted to conceal; but it also depends on something that
            overlaps that archaism, namely a sheer mythic quality imparting to these tales something of the universal validity
            to which all great literature aspires and which Homer achieved consistently and with an apparent ease that must
            be deceptive.
