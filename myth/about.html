        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Greece, the southernmost of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. Geography has greatly influenced the country’s development. Mountains historically restricted internal communications, but the
        sea opened up wider horizons. The total land area of Greece (one-
        fifth of which is made up of the Greek islands) is comparable in size
        to England or the U.S. state of Alabama.
        Greece has more than 2,000 islands, of which about 170 are
        inhabited; some of the easternmost Aegean islands lie just a few
        miles off the Turkish coast. The country’s capital is Athens, which
        expanded rapidly in the second half of the 20th century. Attikí
        (ancient Greek: Attica), the area around the capital, is now home to
        about one-third of the country’s entire population.
        A Greek legend has it that God distributed soil through a sieve and
        used the stones that remained to build Greece. The country’s barren
        landscape historically caused the people to migrate. The Greeks, like
        the Jews and the Armenians, traditionally have been a people of
        diaspora, and several million people of Greek descent live in various
        parts of the world. Xeniteia, or sojourning in foreign lands, with its
        strong overtones of nostalgia for the faraway homeland, has been a
        central element in the historical experience of the Greek people.
        Greece is a country that is at once European, Balkan, Mediterranean,
        and Near Eastern. It lies at the juncture of Europe, Asia, and Africa
        and is heir to the heritages of Classical Greece, the Byzantine
        Empire, and nearly four centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule.

        <h2>Greek Mythology</h2>
        <p>
            <i>The Odyssey</i> incorporates many elements of Greek Mythology, including mentions of Greek Gods. There are many Greek Gods
            involved in Greek Mythology. A few of which are demonstrated in the table below.

        <h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>
        <p>
        The population of Greece, in particular that of northern Greece, has always been characterized by a great deal of ethnic, religious, and
        linguistic diversity. Migrations, invasions, imperial conquests, and 20th-century wars all contributed to this
        cultural diversity, which continues to characterize modern Greece—in spite of several instances of population
        exchanges, which occurred as a result of treaties between Greece and Bulgaria in 1919 and between Greece and
        Turkey in 1923, along with long-standing government policies of assimilation, or Hellenization. According to the
        dominant ideology of the Greek state, all the people of Greece are, or should be, Greek. As a result, the existence
        of ethnic and national diversity in the country has remained a sensitive issue. The Greek government’s official
        position is that there are no ethnic or national minorities in the country and that virtually the entire population is
        Greek. The only minority officially recognized by the Greek government is a religious minority, the Muslim
        minority of Thráki (Thrace), whose existence was acknowledged in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Nonetheless,
        the population of Greece includes people who identify themselves as Turks, Macedonians, Albanians, Aromanians
        (Vlachs), and Roma (Gypsies). Greek is the language of the majority of Cyprus’s population, and enclaves of
        Greeks—as defined by the language they speak—are to be found to different degrees in southern Albania,
        southern Italy, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Greek expatriate communities play a distinctive role in Europe, North and
        South America, Australia, and South Africa.
        </p>
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>The Greek language is one of the oldest attested Indo-European languages, its earliest written form (Linear B)
        dating to about the 15th century BCE. Koine (the language of the New Testament) and Byzantine Greek represent
        the middle phases of Greek. Those ultimately gave way in the 19th century to Modern Greek (except in the liturgy
        of the Greek Orthodox Church, which still uses Koine), although from roughly the 15th century onward, the
        language had a very modern aspect to it. Modern Greek comprises Standard Modern Greek and the various
        regional dialects. Standard Modern Greek is the official state language, and it is an amalgamation of two
        historical forms: Demotic, which is widely spoken, and Katharevusa, a deliberately archaizing form that was
        primarily written, appearing in official government documents and newspapers until the mid-1970s. Separate
        transliteration tables are generally used for Classical and Modern Greek; however, changes in the pronunciation
        of the Greek language and conflicting transliteration conventions have resulted in widespread discrepancies, even
        in the rendering of Modern Greek names in Roman orthography. Although not officially recognized, minority
        languages spoken in the country include Turkish, Macedonian, Albanian (especially in the dialect known as
        Arvanítika, a variety of Tosk Albanian taken to Greece in the 15th century by settlers from what is now Albania),
        Bulgarian, Romany, Aromanian (a form of Eastern Romance, akin to Daco-Romanian, spoken by the Aromanians
        and also called Macedo-Romanian), and Megleno-Romanian (another form of Eastern Romance, spoken in a few
        villages in the north). The form of Greek known as Tsakonian is different enough from other varieties that it could
        be considered a separate language too, and a similar claim could be made for the Pontic variety and the
        Cappadocian variety as spoken now in Greece (these last two occurring in Greece as a result of the population
        movements mandated by the Treaty of Lausanne).
        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>Despite the long Ottoman administration, virtually all of the population belongs to the Church of Greece (Greek
        Orthodox Church). An autocephalous (ecclesiastically independent) Eastern Orthodox church, this body appoints
        Greek Orthodox Easter service,
        Pátmos, Greece

        monastery of St. John the Theologian

        of the Dodekánisa (Dodecanese)
        group in the Aegean Sea.

        metropolitans under the presidency of the archbishop of Athens.
        Almost all Cretans belong to a special branch of the Church of
        Greece headed by the archbishop of Crete, who is directly
        responsible to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, as are
        the monks of Mount Athos, who constitute a semiautonomous entity
        with a Greek governor but with their own administration.
        The Muslim (primarily Sunni) minority, which constitutes most of
        the non-Orthodox sector of the population, is mainly Turkish and
        concentrated in western Thráki and the Dodecanese. Roman and
        Greek Catholics, predominantly located in Athens and the western
        islands formerly under Italian rule, account for the rest, except for a
        few thousand adherents of Protestantism and Judaism. Greece’s
        Jewish population was almost wiped out by the Nazi genocide of
        World War II. (See Holocaust.)
        </p>
        <h2>Cultural Life</h2>
        <p>The important sites of Greek antiquity that first attracted aristocratic and upper-class Europeans to the Greek
        lands in the 18th century and which influenced architectural styles in the West continue to attract tourists from
        throughout the world. Excavated sites such as the supposed tomb of Philip II of Macedon at Verghina, the
        Pompeii-like remains at Akrotíri on the island of Thíra, and the Minoan palace at Zákros on Crete are a few
        examples of a remarkably rich heritage from antiquity that has still not been fully explored. Since the beginning
        of the 20th century, awareness has grown of the architectural and artistic influence of the Byzantine Empire on
        historic Greek churches, frescoes, mosaics, and icons. Recognized too is not only a minor renaissance of Greek
        art and culture during the many centuries under Venetian and western European rule (c. 1204–1669) but also the
        contributions of Greeks to the greater Renaissance of Italy. The Renaissance in Greece—and in Crete in particular
        —produced handsome buildings, frescoes, and icons as well as poetry and drama; examples of these include the
        Venetian Loggia in Iráklion, the paintings of Michael Damaskinos (Michail Damaskenos; flourished late 16th
        century), the romantic-epic poem Erotocritos by Vitséntzos Kornáros, and the pageant-wagon drama Abraham
        and Isaac. In addition, Greek scholars, translators, and printers of the period introduced the classics to western
        Europe.
        Less known to foreigners but highly valued by Greeks today is the culture that emerged in the 19th century, both
        popular and high, as Greeks struggled to establish their new nation-state and language. They took pride in their
        traditional lore and poems, especially their “brigand songs,” which celebrated defiance of their oppressors, while
        such writers as Yannis Psicháris, Andréas Ioannídis Kalvos, Dhionísios Solomós, and Alexandros Papadiamándis
        helped to forge a new Greek identity—one that now took pride in prevailing across centuries against foreign
        occupiers, in preserving the demotic language and popular customs, and in reasserting Greece’s place in the
        history of Western civilization. Greeks celebrate their winning of independence from the Ottoman Empire with a
        national holiday on March 25.
        </p>

        <h2>Daily Life and Social Customs</h2>
        <p>In the hot summers, social life in Greece tends to be outdoors. In small towns and villages the tradition of the
        volta continues, when at sundown much of the population strolls up and down the main street or, on the islands,
        along the shore. In summer and winter much leisure time is passed in the numerous cafés and coffee shops, both
        of which have been traditionally a male preserve. It is also not uncommon to find in a single village one coffee
        shop where the adherents of a particular political party congregate. Television, the Internet, and forms of video
        entertainment have to some extent undermined these traditional leisure patterns.
        Greek cuisine, particularly such sweets as baklava and kataifi, reflects the centuries of Turkish rule. The food in
        Thessaloníki—in northern Greece and part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912—in particular still reflects a strong
        Ottoman influence and is a testimony to the massive influx of refugees from Asia Minor in the 1920s. The
        traditional, healthy diet of Greek peasants in general was based on vegetables, fruit, olives, olive oil, cheese,
        bread, and seafood, meat being a luxury eaten only on special occasions. With the country’s growing affluence,
        meat has come to assume a more important place in the Greek diet, “fast foods” have taken hold in the cities, and
        the incidence of heart disease has risen accordingly.
        Greek society is noted for its strong family structure and a low crime rate. The extended family, and the obligation
        placed on family members to provide mutual support, is of the utmost importance. The centrality of the family
        has been little affected by the rise of the middle class that has been a feature of the development of Greek society
        since the end of World War II. During the 1980s important changes were introduced in Greek family law. Civil
        marriage was instituted in parallel with religious marriage, the dowry system was abolished (though marriages are
        still sometimes seen to some degree as economic alliances in theory), divorce was made easier, and the hitherto
        dominant position of the father in the family was restricted. The great majority of the country’s businesses remain
        small, family-run enterprises. This is especially true of shipping, in which tightly knit clans of families dominate
        the industry. The family structure of industry acts as an impediment to modernization. The wheels of society
        continue to be lubricated by mesa (connections) and rouspheti (the reciprocal dispensation of favours).
        The main holiday periods revolve around Easter and the Feast of Dormition (Assumption) of the Virgin in mid-
        August. Easter is the most important religious and family festival, with many people returning to their native
        villages for the traditional festivities, which include the vigil in church on Saturday evening, the lighting of the
        Holy Fire at midnight on Easter morning, and the roasting of whole lambs on spits for the Easter meal. August is
        the traditional vacation month.
        </p>
        <h2>The Arts</h2>
        <p> Against the background of this extraordinary cultural heritage, Greece enjoys a thriving artistic life. Greece has
        made its greatest contributions in the field of literature (see Greek literature). Constantine Cavafy, an ethnic Greek
        who lived most of his life in Alexandria, Egypt, is frequently ranked among the great poets of the early 20th
        century. His work is suffused with an ironic nostalgia for Greece’s past glories. Two Greek poets have won the
        Nobel Prize for Literature: George Seferis in 1963 and Odysseus Elytis in 1979. The novelist best known outside
        Greece is the Cretan Níkos Kazantzákis, whose Zorba the Greek (1946) was made into a popular film (1964).
        Other 20th-century Greek writers include Kostís Palamás, Angelos Sikelianós, Kostas Varnalis, Pandelís
        Prevelákis, Strátis Myrivílis, Yannis Ritsos, Nikephoros Vrettakos, and Nikos Gatsos. More-contemporary writers
        and poets include Dimitris Lyacos, Nina Rapi, Eleni Vakalo, Ersi Sotiropoulos, and Miltos Sachtouris.
        A number of Greek composers have acquired an international reputation, including Nikos Skalkottas, Manos
        Hadjidakis, and Mikis Theodorakis, and the country has also given the world of music such notables as Dimitri
        Mitropoulos Maria Callas, and Gina Bachauer. Well-known Greek painters and sculptors include Nicolas Ghika,
        Yannis Tsarouchis, Yannis Moralis, Spyros Vassiliou, and Photis Kontoglou.
        Internationally known Greek contributors to theatre and film include Karolos Koun, Melina Mercouri, Costa-
        Gavras, and Theo Angelopoulos. The traditional shadow puppet theatre, Karaghiozis, is now largely extinct,
        having been displaced by television and other leisure pursuits. There is, however, a lively Athenian theatrical
        tradition in which political satire plays an important part.
        Perhaps most significant of all is the enormous influence of ancient Greek art (see Western sculpture; Western
        architecture; Western painting, Greek pottery) and Greek mythology on later Western art and literature. Of
        countless examples that can be offered, a few should suffice to demonstrate the reach of what is known as Greek
        civilization. Such Greek statuary as the kore and the kouros—themselves reflecting an interaction with other
        cultures (particularly that of Egypt)—and later developments represented by such works as the Louvre’s Winged
        Victory of Samothrace provide a major chapter in the art history of Europe and North America. In architecture, the
        Greek temple remains a classic form. Ancient Greek tragedies (such as Euripides’ Medea) and comedies (such as
        Aristophanes’ Lysistrata) were presented in various styles into the 21st century. One of the classic Greek tragedies
        —the fated marriage of Oedipus to his own mother, Jocasta, detailed in Sophocles’ Oedipus cycle—formed a
        keystone of Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory. Another resonant tale, Homer’s Odyssey (8th or 9th century
        BCE), was the basis of Irishman James Joyce’s 20th-century masterwork Ulysses. A moment’s reflection can call
        to mind an abundance of paradigms.
        </p>
    
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> For detailed coverage of earlier history of Greece, see Aegean civilizations and ancient Greek civilization.
        The geophysical structure of Greece played a significant role in shaping its pre-Classical and Classical history and
        continued to be influential into the medieval period, for, in spite of the administrative unity and relative
        effectiveness of the fiscal and military administration of the later Roman and Byzantine states, these still had to
        function in a geophysical context in which communications were particularly difficult. The southern Balkan
        Peninsula has no obvious geographic focal point. The main cities in the medieval period were Thessalonica
        (Modern Greek: Thessaloníki; historically, also called Salonika) and Constantinople (modern Istanbul), yet these
        were peripheral to the peninsula and its fragmented landscape. The degree of Byzantine political control during
        the Middle Ages is clearly reflected in this. In the largely inaccessible Rhodope (Rodópi) Mountains, as well as in
        the Pindus (Píndos) Mountains, state authority, whether Byzantine or Ottoman, always remained a rather distant
        factor in the lives of the inhabitants.
        The relationship between this landscape of mountains, gulf-indented coasts, and valleys on the one hand and the
        sea on the other is fundamental to the cultural as well as to the political and the military history of Greece. The
        sea surrounds Greece except along its northern border. The extended coastline—including such gulfs as those of
        Corinth (Korinthiakós) and Thessalonica, which penetrate deep into the interior—has served as a means of
        communication with surrounding areas to the extent that even interior districts of the Balkans often share in the
        Mediterranean cultural world. The sea was also a source of danger: seaborne access from the west, from the
        south, or from the northeast via the Black Sea made Greece and the Peloponnese (Pelopónnisos) particularly
        vulnerable to invasion and dislocation.

        <h2>Late Roman Administration</h2>
        <p>
        At the beginning of the 4th century, the regions comprised by the modern state of Greece were divided into eight
        provinces: Rhodope, Macedonia, Epirus (Ípeiros) Nova, Epirus Vetus, Thessaly (Thessalía), Achaea, Crete (Kríti),
        and the Islands (Insulae). Of the eight provinces, all except Rhodope and the Islands were a part of the larger
        diocese of Moesia, which extended to the Danube River in the north. (The word diocese originally referred to a
        governmental area governed by a Roman imperial vicar. The secular diocese was subdivided into provinces, each
        with its own governor.) Rhodope belonged to the diocese of Thrace (Thráki), and the Islands were classed as part
        of the diocese of Asiana, consisting of the westernmost provinces of Asia Minor. By the early years of the 5th
        century, administrative readjustments had divided the older diocese of Moesia into two sections, creating in the
        north the diocese of Dacia and in the south that of Macedonia, made up of the provinces of Macedonia I and II,
        with Epirus Novus and Epirus Vetus, Thessaly, Achaea, and Crete. Further changes during the middle of the 6th
        century resulted in the establishment of a military command known as the quaestura exercitus, a zone made up of
        the Islands and Caria, from the diocese of Asiana, together with the province of Moesia II on the Danube; it was
        designed as a means of providing for the armies based along the northern frontier in regions that were too
        impoverished or devastated to adequately support them.
        In turn, these diocesan groups were parts of larger administrative units—the praetorian prefectures. Most of the
        Greek provinces were in the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, except Rhodope, which, as a province of the
        diocese of Thrace, was in the prefecture of Oriens, as were the Islands. This pattern was radically altered by the
        developments of the 7th century.
        Some of the ancient names for the regions of Greece disappeared from everyday use. However, many continued
        to be used in literary and administrative contexts, especially in the administration of the church, or were revived
        by classicizing writers of the late Byzantine period. Thus, Aitolia, Akarnania, Achaea, Arcadia (Arkadía), and
        Lakedaimon were used in the 13th century and after. Similarly, in central Greece, Boeotia (Voiotía), Euboea
        (Évvoia), and Thessaly all survived but in different contexts. Typical of their history is Euboea, which was so
        called until the 8th century, after which it was referred to variously as Chalkis or Euripus. Western writers after
        1204 identified it as Negroponte (“Black Bridge,” after the bridge connecting it to the mainland), although the
        Byzantines also called it Euboea. The names Epirus and Macedonia never dropped out of regular use. However,
        many new names were also coined during the Byzantine period; these tended to be geographic descriptions (such
        as Strymon [Strimón] or Boleron) used for both provincial and administrative divisions as well as to describe
        regions with a particular ethnic composition—for example, Vlachia in southern Thessaly.
